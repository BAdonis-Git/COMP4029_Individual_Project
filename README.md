# Univerisity of Nottingham Computer Science MSci<br>COMP4029 Individual Programming Project
## Overview

This dissertation presents NeuroSpectator, a secure, cloud-based streaming platform, that was developed to broadcast gameplay along-side integrated real-time brain and physiological data from consumer-grade Brain-Computer Interfaces for competitive analysis for performance enhancement, entertainment and research. The project addresses the gap between existing streaming entertainment and emerging neurotechnology by creating a unified integration targeted towards accessibility to the consumer and analytical value to competitive players of digital games. Through research into consumer BCIs, streaming technologies, and competitive gaming dynamics, this work establishes a foundation for meaningful integration of brain data in gaming contexts. The project implemented a modular architecture using .NET MAUI, Microsoft Cloud Services, OBS Webhooks and MediaKind's MK.IO API, with brain data acquisition through the Muse SDK and design choices informed by user feedback. Despite implementation challenges with third-party dependencies, the platform demonstrates the viability of the developed technology. The resulting software is a streaming platform with the necessary abstractions to grow with new BCI devices as they continue to evolve over time.
